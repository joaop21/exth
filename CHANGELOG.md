## 0.3.0 - 2025-04-11

### Added

- Support for dynamic configuration through both inline options and application configuration
- examples directory with practical usage examples

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/joaop21/exth/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## 0.2.2 - 2025-04-07

### Changed

- Moved `Exth.Rpc.Encoding.encode_request/1` logic to `Exth.Rpc.Request.serialize/1`
- Moved `Exth.Rpc.Encoding.decode_response/1` logic to `Exth.Rpc.Response.deserialize/1`
- Removed `Exth.Rpc.Encoding` module
- Transport module does not receive an `encoder/1` and `decoder/1` option
  anymore. It's now direct to call `Exth.Rpc.Request.serialize/1` and
  `Exth.Rpc.Response.deserialize/1` functions.
- These changes aim to reduce the complexity of `Exth.Rpc` and `Exth.Transport`
  modules and make it easier to understand its internals.

[0.2.2]: https://github.com/joaop21/exth/releases/tag/v0.2.2

## 0.2.1 - 2025-04-05

### Changed

- `Exth.Provider` was refactored to reduce its complexity
- Fixed dialyzer warnings on `Exth.Provider` related to `has no local return`.
  Some types were fixed and the dialyzer warning does not appear anymore. No
  more warnings when defining providers.

- Creation of request IDs on `Exth.Rpc.Client.send/2` when no pre-assigned IDs
  are provided
